# Football Outcome Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the outcomes of football matches, specifically whether a certain team wins, loses, or draws. It involves developing predictive models using a dataset containing various match-related variables. The project pipeline includes the following steps:

Exploratory Analysis: Explore the football match dataset to understand its structure, characteristics, and patterns.

Data Preprocessing: Utilize the faltantes.Rmd script to handle missing values and clean the dataset.

Model Training: Train predictive models without missing values using the MODELOS_SIN_FALTANTES.ipynb notebook. Additionally, models trained with missing values are also considered important for robust analysis and you con train models with missing values using MODELOS_CON_FALTANTES.ipynb.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Usage

If you are interested in accessing the data for this project, please visit this link https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/143 and register for the challenge to obtain the dataset.

Then, clone the repository to your local machine.

Execute the provided scripts and notebooks in the following sequence:

a. ANALISIS_EXPLORATORIO.ipynb: Perform an exploratory analysis of the football match dataset.

b. faltantes.Rmd: Preprocess the data to handle missing values.

c. MODELOS_SIN_FALTANTES.ipynb: Train predictive models without missing values.

d. MODELO_CON_FALTANTES.ipynb: Train models without preprocessing missing values.
