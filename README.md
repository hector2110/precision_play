Project Name
Overview

This project aims to develop predictive models based on a dataset. The models are designed to predict certain outcomes based on input variables. The project includes exploratory analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Usage

    Run the Exploratory Analysis script (ANALISIS_EXPLORATORIO.ipynb) to explore the dataset and gain insights into its structure and characteristics.

    Clean the data using the script faltantes.Rmd to handle missing values.

    After handling missing values, use the MODELOS_SIN_FALTANTES.ipynb notebook to train predictive models without missing values.

    Optionally, if missing values are not handled, you can use the MODELO_CON_FALTANTES.ipynb notebook to train models without preprocessing missing values. However, it's recommended to use the models trained without missing values as they tend to perform better.

Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    Jupyter Notebook
    R (for executing faltantes.Rmd)
